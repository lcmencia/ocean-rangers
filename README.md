A fleet of marine drones that will collect mesoplastic out of the great pacific garbage patch and deposit into a collection point to be later transported to the coast
It’s estimated that up to 14 million tons of plastic enters the ocean each year!
This waste that ends up in the ocean degrades into smaller pieces of plastic under the effects of sun and waves, becoming more and more difficult to catch, and posing a bigger threat to marine life.

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) is the largest of the five offshore plastic accumulation zones in the world’s oceans. It is located halfway between Hawaii and California. It’s 3 times the size of France and has an estimated weight of 80.000 tones.

It’s estimated that there is 180x more plastic than food at the surface of the great pacific garbage patch. This directly affects marine life, that confuses the debris and consumes it as food, passing the plastic content which is highly pollutant to it’s predator and eventually to human beings, posing not only a huge environmental threat, but also a health and economic threat, especially to coastal cities.

The United Nations reported that the approximate environmental damage caused by plastic to marine ecosystems represents 13 billion USD. This figure included the cost of beach cleanups and the financial loss incurred by fisheries.

The solution? Several autonomous marine drones, working in sintony, 24 hrs a day, to collect plastic particles which are later placed on a collection point that will be in charge to hold up the whole set of debris that will form a more manageable patch, to be later easily transported to the coast.

The drones will be equipped with solar panels, ultrasonic, geolocation and gyroscopic sensors and a camera, all connected to a LoRaWAN network, which will use Nasa data, and provide it with aditional information.
Once the collection point is full, it will send a signal that will allow passing commercial ships (who can be given financial incentives to do so) or the organization’s own ship to attach the collecting net and drag it to the coast. By using commercial ships we would be reducing our carbon foot print.

As we recognize this is not an easy solution, we want to focus our efforts in one of the four categories of plastic that can be found in the great pacific garbage patch: Mesoplastics

Why mesoplastics? It makes up to 17% of the total mass of the patch, which corresponds to 13.600 tons of plastic waste, that could be later turned into microplastic being a lot harder to address the issue. We want to be there before that happens!

A 2015 study estimated that there's between 15 and 51 trillion pieces of microplastic in the world's oceans, weighing up to 261,000 tons. As more and more plastics are discarded into the environment, microplastic concentration in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch will only continue to increase.

Each drone is expected to collect at least 300 kg of mesoplastic a day, considering an initial fleet of 5 drones, by the end of a whole year it will mean a clean-up of 4% (0,8 % each) of the total mass of mesoplastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch before it turns to microplastic, becoming into a bigger threat to the ocean!

The project would be founded by governmental aid organizations such as the US’s and/or private companies CSR campaings.

We will use NASA datasets to plot the collection path of the drones, using currents, wind, temperature, etc, that can be used to better navigate the autonomous fleet.
